Personal Portfolio Website - WD MSE 2 Project

Project Overview

Hello Sir/Ma'am,
This is my submission for the WD practical file. I have created a Multi-Page Personal Portfolio Website using only HTML5 and CSS3, as per the instructions given in the PDF.

I have tried to make it look professional with a dark theme and made sure it works on mobile phones also (Responsive Design).
